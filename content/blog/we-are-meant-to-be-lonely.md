# We’re Meant To Be Lonely

I’m a man with few friends, which sometimes makes me feel lonely.

Not that I’m antisocial, but I don’t fit in much.

In my youth, I didn’t like football, customizing motorcycles, or care about trends like others. Most of the time, I’m alone with my thoughts.

I used to feel bad, thinking I was weird because others didn’t talk to me much, making me feel unlikeable.

But as I’ve grown, I’ve realized I don’t need to change for others, just do what’s best for me. Loneliness is also unavoidable at times. No matter how many friends we have, they will all eventually go.

## Time Changes Everything

Back then, I used to play music with 3–5 guys, the only people who shared my interest in school. They became my best friends.

Whenever I felt lonely, I would hang out with them. Just being together, and discussing new songs or upcoming music festivals, made me content.

But time changed everything.

We’ve all grown up, each focused on our own lives. Some have married, some are still in college, and others are already working.

When we met, silence dominated. Our lives have diverged, no longer relevant to each other. We’ve become strangers, with no remedy.

I’m sure that every adult experiences the same; year by year, we only become more lonely.

We meet many people from a young age, but by our 20s, our friend circle shrinks. We can only befriend those who relate to our life.

Entering the workforce, we also become busier, with no more time to have fun with friends.

Then all that’s left are parents, spouse, and kids. But time keeps passing by. Sooner or later, our parents will be gone, our kids will grow up, living their own lives.

We finally become the loneliest we’ve ever been.

That’s the sad reality of life.

## It’s Okay To Feel Lonely

I think we’re all unique, shaped by different environments. If only a few can relate to us, what can we do? At some point, we’ll be lonely in our own thoughts.

People also come and go; nothing lasts forever. But having a few true friends is better than none at all.

Loneliness may seem bad, but life is life. Just as people tell us to be happy, there are always unhappy moments.

The best we can do is to respect those who stick by us and be kind to them.

Hopefully, they’ll stay with us for a long time and be there when we need them. Because people can never live without others.
