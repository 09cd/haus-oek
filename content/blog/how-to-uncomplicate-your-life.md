# How To Uncomplicate Your Life

A simple, four-word, generic answer is — Change your belief system.

Just sit for a second and think. How easy our lives would be if we simply did the things we said we were going to do?

The problem starts when we think something, feel something else, and do something completely different. Complicated humans, I must say. But that’s the beauty of it. I love decoding human nature. Because I am surely not easy to understand, lol.

I have been sick and tired of my nonsense thousands of times now. The vicious cycle goes like this — I want to do something, but I don’t do it (laziness, for sure). I know I should be doing that thing, but I still don’t do it. I know if I don’t do something about it, the consequences would be bad — then I do it (because of fear of failure).

## Why do we wait for the “now or never” situation?

Maybe because — We don’t do the things we say we are going to do. We do things our belief system approves of.

See, there are lots of layers to human nature, but the core remains the same. That “core” mindset is who you are.

You can say that you want to travel the world and explore, but if your core belief is that you cannot survive outside without your friends, family, and that certified “comfort zone”, then you are not going anywhere, my friend. (While writing this, my brain is like — Bitch, you listen to yourself sometimes). Only if I followed my advice religiously, lol! But you know, I try, fail, learn, write, try, fail again, write again (Another vicious cycle).

But you have to understand that I am not a professional giving professional advice that guarantees success. I am just a 21-year-old trying to do something. I don’t even know what that something is. Time will tell that (me being optimistic).

## Okay, so where were we?

Yeah, I read all this in some kind of self-help book. That’s when I realized the importance of a solid belief system.

But how do we create this belief system? Or how to change a corrupt one?

That’s the tricky part, isn’t it?

I can write all the crap in the world, and you can read all that crap, but nothing will make a difference if it isn’t followed by a thoughtful action.

Every self-help article comes down to the same shit. Whatever the hell the problem is, the solution is to take small thoughtful actions and have patience.

There is no damn shortcut — trust me, I have searched everywhere.

So what was the conclusion of all this?

If you want to achieve something, but cannot get yourself to work toward it, then start by taking the tiniest action you can. Do it every day for 90 days. Then your brain will start accepting that fact and be like — “That’s what we are going to do now — no escaping”. That message will reach each cell of your body and eventually, slowly, gradually (Add more synonyms if you want), you will have whatever is it that you want.

How amazing, right? We humans tend to think we can do something on our own, and that we are independent. Firstly, it’s all a lie. We are interdependent creatures. We need the help of other people. More importantly, we need every cell of our body to believe in the same thing as we do. Our brain, cell, soul — everything should be in a proper sink.

Because if the unity breaks, there is not going to be any action. And if there’s no action — don’t even think of getting any results, let alone positive.
