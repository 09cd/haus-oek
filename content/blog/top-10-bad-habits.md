# Top 10 Bad Habits You Need To Stay Away From

![hello](/images/2020/bad-habits.jpg)

Bad habits are like slow poisons killing you slowly and you don’t realize it until you hit the rock bottom. Bad habits are hard to break — if not impossible! The sooner you know and try to stay away from bad habits the better you can be at work, life and relationships.

Good habits are hard to develop but easy to live with; bad habits are easy to develop but hard to live with. The habits you have and the habits that have you will determine almost everything you achieve or fail to achieve. — Brian Tracy

If you want to become the person you always wanted to be, then here is a list of bad habits that you need to get rid of as soon as possible. If you don’t have any of these habits, then kudos to you! But, make sure you never develop them.

## Waiting for the right time

Chuck it! There is nothing called the right time! If nothing seems right then make the time right!

If you have decided to start blogging, then this very moment is the right time for you.

What are you waiting for? Excuses? Resources? Hurdles?

“Do not wait: the time will never be ‘just right’. Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command and better tools will be found as you go along.”― Napoleon Hill

I think the above quote sums up everything.

## Using cellphones in bed

Using smartphones, laptops, tablets before bed can really mess up your sleep. The Short-wavelength blue light emitted from these devices can halt the production of melatonin — the sleep-inducing hormone. Hence, you remain alert till late night and that disturbs your circadian rhythm. Over time it may lead to insomnia. And morning sleepiness can screw your productivity.

The simple solution is to wrap your work at least one hour before going to sleep and switch off your phone — so that multiple social media notifications don’t wake you up.

## Saying YES

“YES MAN” will end up with stress, guilt, and unhappiness! How can you say yes to everything? Is it possible for you to attend movies, parties, holiday trips all the time? What about your priorities? How long can you sit and enjoy with people you don’t like? Can you be happy doing an extra shift without pay? Start saying “NO” and be happy.

## Comparing yourself to others

Did you ever get pleasure comparing your career, looks, spouse, salary, wealth to others? All you get is envy and frustration! No peace. Agree? Don’t seek validation! If you are getting pleasure and satisfaction from your work, then you are on the right path. If everyone has to become Einstein who will become an actor, doctor, comedian? Everyone has a unique story that is the source of their creativity, power and personality!

“Comparison is an act of violence against the self.” Iyanla Vanzant

## Being late

Stop going to bed late and hitting that snooze button in the morning! It doesn’t provide you with a sound sleep. Right? You wake up late, skip breakfast, and get in the bad books of people at work or events. How many times will you say sorry? That’s the worst way to start your day because you are going to be unproductive and disorganised throughout the day. And, then sleep at night with “I am never good enough” thoughts.

## Multi-tasking during meetings

Oh, it’s soooooo cool!!! Is that what you think?

Isn’t it rude to talk over phone with your spouse while you are in the middle of a new business deal? Or checking a smartphone while you are on a date?

Not only multitasking creates a bad impression, but signals you are more important to you than anything or anyone else. Also, more tasks mean more mistakes. Multitasking shrinks your brain and lowers your IQ and reduces productivity by 40%.

Multitasking is one of the bad habits that if you quit will take your productivity and efficiency to the next level.
